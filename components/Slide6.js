			<h1>Slide 6: Development Costs and Hiring Developers</h1>
			<div className="d-flex flex-column h-100 justify-content-center">
				<p>
					When it comes to development costs and hiring developers, here&apos;s
					what you need to know:
				</p>

				<p>Salesforce Dev Costs:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Developing on the Salesforce platform can be expensive due to its
						proprietary nature and licensing fees.
					</li>
					<li>
						Hiring developers with experience in Salesforce development can also
						be costly due to the specialized skills required.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>React/Vue Dev Costs:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						React and Vue are open-source JavaScript libraries, which makes them
						free to use.
					</li>
					<li>
						The cost of developing with React or Vue depends on the complexity
						of the project and the hourly rates of the developers involved.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>React/Vue vs Salesforce: Ease in Hiring Developers</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Hiring developers with experience in React or Vue is generally
						easier than hiring Salesforce developers due to the wider pool of
						available talent.
					</li>
					<li>
						This can make React and Vue a more cost-effective choice for
						companies looking to develop in-house or hire outside contractors.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Overall, while Salesforce may have some advantages in terms of
					platform features, the cost and availability of developers is an
					important consideration when choosing a development framework.
